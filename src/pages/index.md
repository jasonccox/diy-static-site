# Hi, I'm Jason!

I'm a software engineer, computer networking nerd, aspiring small business owner, and open source enthusiast. I don't care much for social media, so I've created this site instead as a place to share things with the world. I like to call it my little corner of the Internet.

Here's the general layout of the site:

- [Creations](/creations/): A list of things I've built (often software, but not always)

- [Blog](/blog/): Stories, how-tos, and my thoughts on various topics

- [Resume](/resume.html): A summary of my professional and academic accomplishments

If you'd like to get in touch, email me at [hi@jasoncarloscox.com](mailto:hi@jasoncarloscox.com). I'm happy to answer questions, take feedback, or simply discuss interesting topics. (I'm not interested in advertisements or offers to optimize my website, though, and I won't respond to such emails.)
