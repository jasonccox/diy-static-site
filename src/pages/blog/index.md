Occasionally I write about my something I've done or my thoughts on a particular topic. Don't expect any sort of consistent schedule, though!

- [Why I Switched to a Super Simple Static Site](./switch-to-static.html): For the last year and a half I ran my personal website using Grav CMS with my own Webfolio theme. However, it's now a super simple static site built with Pandoc and GNU Make. In this post, I explain why I decided to make that switch.

- [On Self-Hosting](./on-self-hosting.html): After a failed attempt at self-hosting a few years ago, I eventually decided to give it another shot. It's been a fun, satisfying adventure, and I highly recommend you try it as well.

- [Setting Up ZFS on a ROCKPro64 Running Debian Buster](./zfs-on-rockpro64.html): I bought a ROCKPro64 single-board computer that to use as a home server. Once it arrived, I quickly discovered that setting up ZFS on it was going to be a bit tricky. After a few hours of troubleshooting, I finally figured it out -- here's how to get it working.

- [Basic C++ Unit Testing with Coverage Using Catch2 and Gcov](./cpp-testing-with-coverage.html): I wrote a basic C++ linked list implementation to sharpen my skills, and I quickly found myself in need of a good way to test my code. I found Catch2, a simple C++ testing framework, and then used Gcov to ensure that my tests were covering all the code. By no means am I an expert, but I'll go ahead and share what I've learned so far.

- [Using Letters As Arrow Keys on Linux and Mac](./letters-as-arrow-keys.html): When I found myself sitting at a computer writing code for 40 hours a week for the first time, I started looking for ways to make my computer work more comfortable and efficient. After a bit of research, I figured out how to remap a modifier key (e.g., Ctrl, Alt, etc.) plus i/j/k/l to the arrow keys.
